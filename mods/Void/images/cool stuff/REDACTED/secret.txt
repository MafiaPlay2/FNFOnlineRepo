I'm assuming you've played through the mod by this point, hope you enjoyed!

I just want to thank everyone who's stuck with me while I made this mod.
Honestly I can't believe I actually managed all this. And wether you've never
heard of me and my YT channel, or you've been here since the beginning, just
thank you so much for playing this passion project of mine. It really means a lot.
I got one last thing before we're done here, though.

Down for one more song?

Type the first half of my name in freeplay. ^-^
